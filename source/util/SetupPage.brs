' Local setup page — the channel serves a one-field web form on the LAN so a
' phone can paste an add-on manifest URL instead of the user typing it on the
' remote with the on-screen keyboard.
'
' Everything here runs on the MAIN thread. The listener is registered on the
' same roMessagePort as the screen and source/main.brs dispatches
' roSocketEvent into SetupServerPoll inside its existing Wait loop, so the
' socket lifecycle must never block: reads are driven by notifyReadable, a
' partial write is parked on notifyWritable, and a finished response always
' closes the connection (Connection: close, no keep-alive bookkeeping).
'
' Two halves, deliberately split:
'
'   * pure helpers — SetupRequestState, SetupHeaderValue, SetupFormValue,
'     SetupValidateManifestUrl, SetupLanAddress, the HTML builders and
'     SetupHttpResponse. No sockets, no device objects, so
'     tests/setuppage.test.brs can drive all of it in the brs interpreter;
'   * SetupServerStart / SetupServerPoll / SetupServerClose — thin wrappers
'     around roStreamSocket that the tests never reach, kept to the shape of
'     the echo server in the roStreamSocket reference so the API surface is
'     the documented one.
'
' String indexing is the method form throughout (s.Mid(i, n), s.InStr(x),
' s.Left(n)), which is ZERO-based — the global Mid(s, i, n) is one-based and a
' single convention would silently split this file in two. Everything here is
' ASCII-only by design (the byte count in Content-Length stops matching Len()
' the moment a character outside ASCII shows up).
'
' The page is unauthenticated by design: it binds the device's LAN address, it
' is printed on the TV, and it sets nothing but an add-on the TV then confirms
' on screen. Nothing here is reachable from outside the network.

' The one port the page binds. Named rather than inlined because the address
' printed on the TV and the address the listener binds are the same fact, and
' a typo in one of two literals would show an address that refuses to load.
