' ScreenStack unit tests.
'
' ScreenStack talks to the scene only through FindNode, node.visible,
' node.callFunc and node.SetFocus, so the harness fakes the scene with the same
' tiny surface. Every assertion printed by the harness is a lock on a stack
' behavior: push shows + enters, pop hides + blurs + exits + refocuses, back
' delegates, popTo walks the stack, and the bottom screen is never popped away.
