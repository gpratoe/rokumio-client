' Why this exists: every outbound request to a DOMAIN intermittently fails with
' status=-7 ("Could not connect to server") in tens of milliseconds, while the
' one request that uses an IP literal (the LAN streaming server) never fails.
'
' Two runs of the first version already answered the easy questions:
'
'   DNS is not the cause. Every host resolved 3/3 on every run, through the
'   same IPv4 stack roUrlTransfer uses.
'
'   The CA bundle is not the fix. A single HTTPS request to the failing host
'   succeeded 9/9 WITHOUT SetCertificatesFile, while the same request WITH it
'   failed most early runs (its failures are connect-level -7, not TLS).
'
' What was left is the shape the failures cluster in: one sequential request is
' reliable, but the same request under six-at-once, or alongside the app's own
' parallel startup tasks, fails. So this version measures CONCURRENCY directly:
'
'   dev      roDeviceInfo verbatim (RSSI, txFailed, protocol, gateway, DNS
'            servers), link/internet status, and whether the device has wired
'            hardware. Names the radio quality and the resolver in use.
'   A-E      the five-rung sequential ladder below.
'   dns      explicit resolution of each host, three times.
'   soak     N sequential requests, nothing else in flight. If these all pass,
'            single connections are reliable and the problem is concurrency;
'            if some fail, the link itself drops under no load.
'   sweep    bursts of 1/2/3/4/6/8 at once, drained between, to find the size at
'            which connections start dropping.
'   versions the size-6 burst under AUTO (default), forced "http2" (connection
'            sharing on one connection), and forced "1.1" (one connection per
'            transfer). Roku's docs say HTTP/2 sharing requires all transfers
'            from the same thread; the app issues from many Task threads.
'
' The probe ladder (A..E) is a control ladder, each rung changing ONE thing:
'
'   A  LAN, plain HTTP, IP literal        known-good baseline
'   B  WAN, plain HTTP, IP literal        internet reachable WITHOUT DNS
'   C  WAN, plain HTTP, hostname          internet reachable WITH DNS
'   D  WAN, HTTPS, hostname, no CA bundle how the app behaves today
'   E  WAN, HTTPS, hostname, + CA bundle  the certificate hypothesis
'
' B against C isolates DNS; D against E isolates certificates.
'
' Everything is self-contained so it can be deleted in one move: no probe goes
' through Transport, and every probe builds its own roUrlTransfer.

' CABundlePath() rather than duplicated, so the path the probe applies and the
' path the verdict names cannot drift apart.
