' StoreHost — the single owner of the app's data layer.
'
' Every store instance in this app is built HERE, once, and nowhere else. The
' store classes are plain bsc classes: an instance is an roAssociativeArray
' whose members are function references, and Roku copies that array the moment
' it crosses a component boundary — as a callFunc argument, a callFunc return
' or a declared interface field — dropping every function member. That is why
' screens could never hold a store: the copy arrived data-only and the first
' method call died with &hf4 "Member function not found".
'
' So nothing here is ever handed out. What crosses is this NODE, which Roku
' passes by reference, and what comes back over callFunc is plain data only:
' strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and assoc arrays of records. The classes
' are unchanged and still unit-tested in source/stores; this file only
' re-exports the surface the components actually use, one line per entry point.
'
' The pattern is the one the task components already use (see
' AddonsInstallTask.xml): include the store sources into the component that
' needs them and call them there. Those tasks can afford their own instance
' because they are stateless per-request wrappers; the session-aware stores
' below are not, which is exactly why they live in one place and are handed
' around as a node.

    ' concrete session and must never see a blank one.
    ' The locals are named away from the classes and the function they collide
    ' with: BrightScript identifiers are case-insensitive, so a local called
    ' authStore IS the class AuthStore to the compiler, and a local called
    ' sessionType IS the function EffectiveSessionType below.
