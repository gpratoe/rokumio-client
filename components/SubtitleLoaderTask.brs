' SubtitleLoaderTask — fetch the caption tracks for the playing video off the
' UI thread. The screen already picked the add-on that advertises the
' "subtitles" resource, so only its address comes in. The store + transport are
' built fresh inside the task scope — no object created on the render thread is
' shared across the thread boundary. The result never gates playback: subtitles
' attach whenever they arrive, before or after the stream starts.
'
' Why the request is retried here, and why the answer says whether it was worth
' retrying. A provider that could not be reached used to be indistinguishable
' from one that has no captions for this title: both arrived as { ok: false,
' subtitles: [] }, the screen's only test was `not result.ok`, and the drain read
' both as "this provider has nothing" and moved on. So one timed-out request
' cost the user captions for the rest of the play, and nothing anywhere said the
' request had failed — which is exactly what it looks like on a flaky link, and
' what it looked like in the field: no captions on one entry into a title, and 98
' tracks from the same provider seconds later on the next entry.
'
' The classification is on the store's three-state `status`, not on the error
' string, because the string cannot answer it (see SubtitlesStore.Subtitles).
'
' The wait between attempts is bounded by a COUNT, never by a clock reading —
' StreamResolveTask's probe loop is the same shape and says why. Waiting is the
' point of a Task: Wait() aborts the brs interpreter's run and Ticks() does not
' exist in it, so a wait loop in store code would be neither exercised by the
' suite nor timed. Two arguments because that is the signature BrighterScript
' checks against (BS1002); an invalid port is Roku's own one-argument Wait.

' Wrapped because it runs on the fetch path, inside the loop whose whole job is to
' succeed: a print that raised would be caught by the catch below and reported as a
' definite failure, turning the diagnostic into the fault. It is the only thing in
' this task allowed to fail silently, and it cannot affect the result either way.
'
' No other task or store in this app prints, so there is no precedent proving a
' print works from a Task's own interpreter. That is why this is defensive rather
' than because the language cannot do it: if the field turns out not to be
' available here, the line is lost and the fetch is untouched.

' the caller. Driven by the store's `issued` + `status` pair, and the ORDER matters:
' `issued` is asked first because it is the only question the sign of status cannot
' answer.
'
'   "definite" — we never made the request at all (`issued = false`): our own bad
'                input. The next request would be byte-identical.
'   "retry"    — we asked and never heard back. status < 0 is the transport saying
'                it could not complete the transfer at all (DNS, refused
'                connection, TLS); status 0 is a timeout or a transfer that would
'                not start. Worth another go — and cheap: these fail in
'                milliseconds, not after the timeout ceiling.
'   "server"   — it answered 5xx. Transient on its side, so another go is
'                reasonable, but this is the add-on being unwell rather than the
'                device being unable to reach it.
'   "definite" — it answered 4xx. Another identical request changes nothing.
'
' A successful empty list is not a failure and has no kind at all.
'
' NOTE: an earlier version of this tested `if answer.status < 0 then return
' "definite"`, intending to catch only its own -1 pre-request sentinel. Transport
' reports a NEGATIVE status for every transport failure, so that one line
' classified every connect refusal as non-retryable — the exact opposite of what it
' was for. A refused connection never got a second try.
'
' `issued` and `status` are read defensively rather than tested for truth: a
' missing field throws &h18 on this runtime (the trap MainScene.onAddonSyncResult
' documents), so `if not answer.issued` is not safe against a result that predates
' the flag.
