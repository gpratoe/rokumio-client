' StreamResolveTask — resolve a torrent stream to a playable URL off the UI
' thread, and make sure the streaming server will actually serve it.
'
' Direct-URL streams never get here (the screen plays them as-is).
'
' The task owns the wait, and that is the point of it. Building the URL needs no
' request, but the Video node's first request is a cold engine: the server has to
' gather metadata over DHT and trackers before it can answer, and the node's load
' patience is far shorter than ours. A node that cannot load in time reports the
' stream as FINISHED — no error, no message, the buffering indicator simply goes
' away — which is why a first play can die instantly while a second play of the
' same title gets partway, having found the engine already warm.
'
' So the playlist is asked for here, on a worker thread, until the server will
' serve one. The URL is handed over either way when the attempts run out, which
' makes this a floor on how long the player waits and never a reason it cannot
' start: the worst case is today's behaviour plus a delay.
'
' The engine is asked for first, and until it was, the loop above could not do
' its job. Asking the playlist for a torrent the server has not been told to make
' an engine is not a request that takes too long — it is one that never completes,
' which is what six timed-out probes and a 44-second wait turned out to be. So the
' bare torrent route is asked for first, mirroring what Stremio's client does, and
' the engine exists before anything asks it for anything.
'
' Two requests, because one of them was not enough. A HEAD of the bare route gets
' the engine CREATED and returns in milliseconds, so it said nothing about whether
' the engine could then answer — the probe behind it kept finding out the slow
' way. Stremio's client follows that HEAD with a ranged GET of the first 64KB and
' lets it block until the engine has torrent metadata, and the server's log for a
' device that starts cleanly shows exactly that request sitting between the HEAD
' and the /hls.m3u8. So the warm-up does the same two requests, which turns "the
' engine exists" into "the engine can serve" before the probe ever runs.
'
' The probe rides back attached to the result. "How many times was it asked, and
' what did the server say" is the diagnosis if it is still wrong, which is the
' whole reason this file keeps a record instead of only waiting.
'
' The wait policy lives here rather than in PlaybackStore on purpose. Wait()
' aborts the brs interpreter's run and Ticks() does not exist in it, so a wait
' loop in store code would be neither exercised by the suite nor timed; the task
' is the one place whose blocking is expected.

' The wait is bounded by a COUNT of attempts, never by a clock reading. An earlier
' version measured elapsed milliseconds through
' CreateObject("roDateTime").AsMilliseconds() — a method this codebase has never
' put on a device; the only two it does use are ToISOString() and GetYear() — and
' the device answered &hf4, member function not found. Because the throw landed
' inside resolve()'s own try it took the result down with it: a URL that had
' already resolved correctly was thrown away, and every torrent reported "resolve
' FAILED: Member function not found" while direct URLs, which skip this file's
' wait entirely, played fine. Counting attempts needs no platform API at all, and
' a request that stalls ends at the probe's own short timeout rather than at a
' deadline somebody has to poll.
