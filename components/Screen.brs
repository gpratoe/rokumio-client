' Screen — the base every screen extends.
'
' The screen contract (documented in this header, previously source/core/Screen.bs)
' is now a real component, declared once and implemented here with defaults:
'
'   function SetStores(storeHost as object, - binds the data layer to the screen.
'                        scene as object)     Only a NODE crosses a component
'                                           boundary by reference: as a callFunc
'                                           argument, a callFunc return or a
'                                           declared interface field, Roku copies
'                                           an associative array and drops every
'                                           function member, and a bsc class
'                                           instance is exactly that. So a store
'                                           instance can never be handed over, and
'                                           each attempt at it died on device with
'                                           &hf4 "Member function not found in
'                                           BrightScript Component or interface".
'                                           What arrives instead is the StoreHost
'                                           NODE (one reference, the mechanism the
'                                           pairing task already uses through its
'                                           declared taskNode field), and what
'                                           comes back over callFunc is plain data
'                                           only: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays
'                                           and assoc arrays of records. m.stores
'                                           holds that one node under a per-store
'                                           alias, so a call site reads
'                                           m.stores.addons.callFunc("AddonsGetAll")
'                                           and gets data, never a live object.
'                                           A bind that comes up short reports the
'                                           failing hop to the Scene, which paints
'                                           it (see SetStores).
'   function OnEnter(params as object)    - called when the screen is pushed or
'                                           restored; params is invalid when it is
'                                           only being uncovered by a pop.
'   function OnExit()                     - called when the screen is popped.
'   function OnBackPressed() as boolean   - true means the screen swallowed Back
'                                           (e.g. a backdrop or dialog inside it);
'                                           false lets the stack pop the screen —
'                                           the default, so a screen that handles
'                                           no back-press edge just pops.
'   function BlurFocus()                  - drop any inline focus the screen holds
'                                           (chips, secondary lists) so a blurred
'                                           node never eats OK/arrow keys again.
'                                           No-op by default; screens that hold
'                                           secondary focus override it.
'
' Screens that implement a lifecycle function keep their override in their own
' script (and declare it in their own interface, mirroring how every screen
' worked before this base existed); these defaults answer the calls a screen
' never overrides. This file touches nothing but m.stores and platform globals,
' so it resolves from any screen's scope with no cross-file dependencies.

' The store hand-off is the one thing every screen depends on, and every way it
' can fail looks the same from the outside: an empty grid and a "0 add-ons"
' subtitle, with no crash and nothing in the log. That is exactly how two
' shipping bugs hid here, so a bind that comes up short reports the failing hop
' to the Scene, which owns the one painted strip that shows it. An empty reason
' clears this screen's fault.
'
' BrightScript print cannot be that channel: Roku routes print to the Dev
' Console, not to the device console this app is debugged from, so a print-based
' diagnostic is invisible exactly where these bugs were found. Hence the strip.
'
' The reason strings name the hop, because the three causes need different
' fixes: no host node reached this screen, the host did not answer, or the store
' answered with nothing.

    ' between components by reference. What comes back over callFunc is plain

    ' whole path end to end (node arrived, host answered, forwarder exists, store
