This file records the direct development-time dependencies and generated icon

## Generated icons

`scripts/generate_assets.mjs` downloads the Material Design Icons listed in the
script through Iconify and rasterizes them for the Roku UI. Material Design
Icons are distributed under Apache-2.0; see the
[MaterialDesign repository](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) for
the upstream notices.

The support QR code, vignette, stream metadata icons, and Rokumio branding
assets are generated or authored for this project. Verify ownership before
reusing them outside Rokumio client.

Some assets or references under the name “Stroku” may still remain in the codebase.
These belong to the original Stroku Native project and have been retained as part
of the transition to Rokumio.

## External services and trademarks

Rokumio client can connect to Stremio services and user-supplied add-ons, but it
does not operate those services or redistribute their content. Roku and
Stremio are trademarks of their respective owners. Rokumio client is an
independent project and is not endorsed by either company.
